First simulation: Gate mac/main_stage0.mac
Building of the carbon prompt-gamma database with a low nr of protons

Second simulation: Gate mac/main_stage1_vpg_patient.mac
Estimation of the voxelized PG source in a carbon box

Third simulation: Gate mac/main_stage2_vpg_patient.mac
Test the use of a voxelized PG source with a sphere shell root phase space

Analysis:
- check the PG TH2D root database
- check the voxelized PG source files, energy and emission time, both mhd
- check the root phase space
